# First-ML
## Introduction
This project is the starting point to my machine learning practical experience. I've been reading and watching videos for a long time now but never put anything in practice because my intension was to use ML in a robot simulation but I thought about it and building a simulation entirely would mine my energy to make the actual ML. Anyways, I have a really good understanding of the theory but not the actual thing.
For my first project, I'm going to make a ML that gets a list of bucketized data (just a list of 0s and 1s that represents the real data)of 5 elements that represents a single hand (if the finger is up it's 1 an if it's down it's 0). 
I'm using as inspiration an anime called Naruto. In this anime's world, the ninjas uses the hand positioning, called seal, to manipulate an energy, called chakra. 
This project is the complementation of an another project that I intend to make that consistes in building a glove that identifies the state of the fingers of the user.
I'm aware that everything in this project could be make using computational vision. The thing is, computational vision is not the most efficient method to use in embedded systems or in microcontrollers and I want to be able to build an robot that uses ML, mainly, to use in the robotic team in my colege that I'm member called TERA (team of study in aplied robotics, literally translate from portuguese.

I can't wait to make this work.
